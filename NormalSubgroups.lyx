\begin_layout Chapter*
\noindent
Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These lecture notes are organised in the form of a 
\emph on
fictitious narrative
\emph default
.
 It is always a pleasant experience when the development of any subject
 is conveyed in a chronological order.
 This is seldom feasible since the historical narrative is never linear.
 There are many detours and many many people have contributed to the subject.
 Many ideas may not have been ripe at the time of their discovery but over
 a period of time people may have realized their importance.
 These ideas then become definitions and Theorems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most books these days are written in a 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 fashion.
 While such an approach has its pedagogical value especially for a begining
 student it tends to become very dry.
 I wonder as to how many people would love to read a dry and boring novel.
 I have tried to write an interesting novel with the aim of keeping the
 reader engrossed.
 In most lectures a 
\emph on
natural question
\emph default
 has been asked and the reasoning behind the Theorems and their proofs has
 been made 
\emph on
plausible.
 
\emph default
Although such a reasoning may not be true in the historical sense it would
 certainly reveal why a particular idea was discovered and even if it was
 not discovered that way then sooner or later the discovery would have been
 imminent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To give a concrete example, in the chapter on Normal Groups, the notion
 of 
\emph on
kernel
\emph default
 arose quite naturally in the context of 
\emph on
homomorphisms
\emph default
.
 These in turn arose from the multiplicative property of an 
\emph on
isomorphism
\emph default
 a topic which originated in the following question: when are two groups
 ``same''? It was discovered that the kernel of a homomorphism was a subgroup
 of the original group with many interesting properties.
 So the natural question was the converse: is every subroup of a group the
 kernel of a homomorphism? In trying to answer this question we are very
 naturraly led to the concept of 
\emph on
conjugation
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
normality
\emph default
.
 Having answered this question and reached an important landmark we explore
 the beauty of the surroundings and are led to motivated proofs of the three
 
\emph on
Isomorphism Theorems
\emph default
 which are the corner stones of Group Theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hope these lectures are useful and make an interesting reading

\begin_layout Chapter
Permutation Groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Permutations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 be a set.
 A permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is simply a bijection 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\, S\longrightarrow S$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "permutations"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 be a set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(i) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 be two permutations of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Then the composition of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is a permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(ii) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 be a permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Then the inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Follows from the well known results on functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "permutationgroup"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 be a set.
 The set of all permutations, under the operation of composition of permutations
, forms a group 
\begin_inset Formula $A(S)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "permutations"

\end_inset

(i) implies that the set of permutations is closed under composition of
 functions.
 We check the three axioms for a group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Associativity follows from the general fact that composition of functions
 is associative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $i:\, S\longrightarrow S$
\end_inset

 be the identity function from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 be a permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\circ f=f\circ i=f.
\]

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 acts as the identity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 be a permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Then the inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 by Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "permutations"

\end_inset

(ii) and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\circ g=g\circ f=i,
\]

\end_inset

by definition.
 Thus inverses exist and 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is a group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "cardpermgrp"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 be a finite set with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 elements.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $A(S)$
\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

, this is obvious, since there are only two possible arrangements of two
 elements.
 For arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, we shall prove our assertion by mathematical induction, i.e., assuming that
 the assertion is valid for any set with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 elements, we shall show that it is also valid for every set with 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 elements.
 Thus, we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 elements give 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 permutations, and we consider any set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 elements, which we denote by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left\{ a_{1},\ldots,a_{n+1}\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

Consider first the permutations whose first element is 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 To obtain all possible permutations of this type, we must put 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 in the first position and then write down all possible permutations of
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 remaining elements; by assumption, the number of such permutations equals
 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 In just the same way, the number of permutations whose first element is
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}$
\end_inset

 also equals 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 Thus, the total number of different permutations of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},\ldots,a_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 equals
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n!\left(n+1\right)=1\cdot2\cdots n\cdot\left(n+1\right)=\left(n+1\right)!,
\]

\end_inset

 as was to be proved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Group 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "groupS_n"

\end_inset

The group 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the set of permutations of the first 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 natural numbers and is called the 
\emph on
symmetric group of degree 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We want a convenient way to represent an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The first way, is to write an element 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 as a matrix.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
3 & 1 & 5 & 4 & 2
\end{pmatrix}\in S_{5}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we write a row with 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

 at the top and right below write another row with the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(1),\sigma(2),\ldots,\sigma(n)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(3)=5$
\end_inset

.
 With this notation it is easy to write down products and inverses.
 For example suppose that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
3 & 1 & 5 & 4 & 2
\end{pmatrix}\qquad\tau=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
4 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 5
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
1 & 4 & 5 & 2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

On the other hand
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma\tau=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
4 & 5 & 3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{5}$
\end_inset

 is not abelian.
 The inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is obtained by exchanging the rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with this way of representing elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 is that we don’t see much of the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 this way.
 For example, it is very hard to figure out the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 from this representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Cycles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "cycle"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 be an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-
\series bold
cycle
\series default
 if there are distinct integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,2,\ldots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(a_{1})=a_{2},\tau(a_{2})=a_{3},\ldots,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(a_{k})=a_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 fixes every other integer.
 More compactly
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau\left(a_{i}\right)=\begin{cases}
a_{i+1} & i<k\\
a_{1} & i=k\\
a_{i} & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
A two cycle is also called a 
\emph on
transposition
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
2 & 3 & 4 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

is a 4-cycle in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{4}$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
1 & 5 & 3 & 2 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

is a 3-cycle in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{5}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Now given a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-cycle 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 , there is an obvious way to represent it, which is much more compact than
 the first notation.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau=\left(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the two examples above become,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(1,2,3,4\right)
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(2,5,4\right).
\]

\end_inset

Note that there is some redundancy.
 For example, obviously
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(2,5,4\right)=\left(5,4,2\right)=\left(4,2,5\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "orderofcycle"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\left(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 be a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-cycle.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 has order 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We can write 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j+1}=\tau^{j}\left(a_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq j<k$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{k}\left(a_{1}\right)=a_{1}$
\end_inset

it follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau^{k}\left(a_{j+1}\right) & = & \tau^{k}\left(\tau^{j}\left(a_{1}\right)\right)\\
 & = & \tau^{j}\left(\tau^{k}\left(a_{1}\right)\right)\\
 & = & \tau^{j}\left(a_{1}\right)\\
 & = & a_{j+1.}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{k}$
\end_inset

 is the identity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
If 
\begin_inset Formula $0<l<k$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{l}$
\end_inset

 is not the identity since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{l}\left(a_{1}\right)=a_{l+1}\neq a_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "disjointcyclescommute"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\left(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\left(b_{1},b_{2},\ldots,b_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

be disjoint cyles i.e., the sets 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\left\{ a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\left\{ b_{1},b_{2},\ldots,b_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

are disjoint.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\tau=\tau\sigma.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma\tau\right)\left(i\right)=\left(\tau\sigma\right)\left(i\right)$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\left\{ 1,2,\ldots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\sigma\tau\right)\left(i\right)=\begin{cases}
\sigma\left(i\right) & i\in A\\
\tau\left(i\right) & i\in B\\
i & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\qquad\left(\tau\sigma\right)\left(i\right)=\begin{cases}
\sigma\left(i\right) & i\in A\\

\end_inset

Let

\end_inset

 be any element of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 Then

 may be expressed as a product of disjoint cycles.
 This factorisation is unique up to order.

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & \cdots & n\\
1 & 2 & \cdots & n
\end{pmatrix}=\left(1\right)\left(2\right)\cdots\left(n\right).
\]

\end_inset

Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is a non-trivial permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We will show that there exists a cycle 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{1},\ldots,a_{j})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\{a_{k}\,\colon\,1\le k\le j\}\subseteq\{k\,\colon\,1\le k\le n\}
\]

\end_inset

 and a permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sigma & = & (a_{1},\ldots a_{j})\circ\tau\\
\tau(a_{k}) & = & a_{k},\;1\leq k\leq j.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Since the permutation is not trivial, there exists 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(i)\neq i$
\end_inset

.
 Chose the smallest such 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Define a sequence inductively as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_{1} & = & i\\
a_{k+1} & = & \sigma(a_{k}),\ k\geq1.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Consider the set
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ a_{k}\,\colon\, k\in\boldsymbol{\mathbf{N}}\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

As there are only finitely many integers between 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, we must have some repetitions, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=a_{j}$
\end_inset

 , for some 
\begin_inset Formula $k<j$
\end_inset

.
 Pick the smallest 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 for which this happens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We will show that 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq1$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma\left(a_{k-1}\right)=a_{k}=a_{j}=\sigma\left(a_{j-1}\right).
\]

\end_inset

As 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is injective, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k-1}=a_{j-1}$
\end_inset

.
 But this contradicts our choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 be the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-cycle 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{1},\ldots,a_{j})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\rho^{-1}\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau(a_{k})=a_{k},\;1\leq k\leq j.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This shows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\rho\tau=(a_{1},\ldots a_{j})\circ\tau.
\]

\end_inset

Now by an obvious induction, we may assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is a product of 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 disjoint cycles 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{2},\rho_{3},\ldots,\rho_{m}$
\end_inset

 which fixes the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{j}\right\} .$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\rho\tau=\rho_{1}\rho_{2}\ldots\rho_{m},
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}=\rho.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof

\series bold
Uniqueness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\rho_{1}\rho_{2}\ldots\rho_{m}=\tau_{1}\tau_{2}\ldots\tau_{l}
\]

\end_inset

are two factorization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 into disjoint cycles.
 We may assume that there are no 1-cycles because they can be cancelled
 from both the sides.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}\left(i\right)=j$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j.$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{k}\left(i\right)\neq i$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 By disjointness, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{k}\left(i\right)=j=\rho_{1}\left(i\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly we can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}\left(j\right)=\tau_{k}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\left(j\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Continuing this way, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}=\tau_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Now cancel these terms from both sides and proceed by induction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof above may appear lengthy and complicated but in practice the procedure
 is really simple as illustrated below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $n=6$
\end_inset

, and consider the permutation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
3 & 6 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 5
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Applying the construction in the proof of Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cycledecomposition"

\end_inset

, we can represent this permutation as the following product of cycles:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
3 & 6 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 5
\end{pmatrix}=\left(1,3,4\right)\left(2,6,5\right),
\]

\end_inset

 where the order of the factors on the right plays no role.

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that we have listed the cycle types in ``alphabetical'' order, which
 makes it easy to enumerate all the types for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "cardinalityofcycletype"

\end_inset

Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in S_{n}$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1},m_{2},\ldots m_{s}$
\end_inset

 be the distinct integers (including 1 if applicable) in the cycle type
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, and let there be 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$
\end_inset

 cycles of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 (Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum k_{i}m_{i}=n$
\end_inset

).
 Then the number of permutations of the cycle type 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\underbrace{m_{1},m_{1},\ldots,m_{1}}_{k_{1}\mathrm{times}},\underbrace{m_{2},m_{2},\ldots,m_{2}}_{k_{2}\mathrm{times}},\ldots,\underbrace{m_{s},m_{s},\ldots,m_{s}}_{k_{s}\mathrm{times}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

is exactly
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{n!}{(k_{1}!m_{1}^{k_{1}})(k_{2}!m_{2}^{k_{2}})\cdots(k_{r}!m_{s}^{k%_{s})
}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Consider a particular arrangement (i.e.
 permutation), and consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$
\end_inset

 cycles of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

 in that permutation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Each of the cycles can be written in 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

 different ways (by starting with a different element).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Also, the cycles themselves can appear in any of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}!$
\end_inset

 possible orders while still representing the same permutation.
 Thus if, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}=2$
\end_inset

 and the first cycle contains 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},\ldots,a_{l}$
\end_inset

 while the second contains 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1},\ldots,b_{l}$
\end_inset

, that is the same permutation as if the first cycle contained 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1},\ldots,b_{l}$
\end_inset

 and the second contained 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},\ldots,a_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
So there are 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}!m_{i}^{k_{i}}$
\end_inset

 equivalent permutations considering the cycles of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 So the total number of permutations, considering each of the possible cycle
 orders, equivalent to the given permutation is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(k_{1}!m_{1}^{k_{1}})(k_{2}!m_{2}^{k_{2}})\cdots(k_{s}!m_{s}^{k%_{s}
})
\]

\end_inset

and the result follows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Thus the number of distinct permutations of cycle type 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\underbrace{m_{1},m_{1},\ldots,m_{1}}_{k_{1}\mathrm{times}},\underbrace{m_{2},m_{2},\ldots,m_{2}}_{k_{2}\mathrm{times}},\ldots,\underbrace{m_{s},m_{s},\ldots,m_{s}}_{k_{s}\mathrm{times}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{n!}{(k_{1}!m_{1}^{k_{1}})(k_{2}!m_{2}^{k_{2}})\cdots(k_{s}!m_{s}^{k%_{s}
})}=\frac{n!}{{\displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{s}}m_{i}^{k_{i}}k_{i}!}.

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in S_{n}$
\end_inset

 be a permutation with cycle type 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n_{1},n_{2},\ldots,n_{r}\right)$
\end_inset

 The order of

be the decomposition of

\begin_inset Formula $n_{1},n_{2},\ldots,n_{r}$

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 hence 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma^{m}=e=\rho_{1}^{m}\rho_{2}^{m}\ldots\rho_{r}^{m}.
\]

\end_inset

It follows that for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{i}^{m}=e.
\]

\end_inset

By Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{i}$

 has order 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$

 But
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 Them 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$

 defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\sim j\iff\exists k\in\boldsymbol{\mathbf{N}}\,\colon\,\sigma^{k}\left(i\right)=j

\end_inset

 is an equivalence.
 The equivalence class containing

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ i,\sigma\left(i\right),\ldots,\sigma^{r-1}\left(i\right)\right\}

Let

 be the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 is reflexive because 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{m}\left(i\right)=i$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\left\{ 1,2,\ldots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

 is symmetric because 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{k}\left(i\right)=j\iff\sigma^{m-k}\left(j\right)=i$
\end_inset

 (observe that WLOG we may take 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq k<m$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Finally 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{s}\left(i\right)=j,\sigma^{t}\left(j\right)=k$
\end_inset

 implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{s+t}\left(i\right)=k$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

is transitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[i\right]$
\end_inset

 be the equivalence class containing 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ i,\sigma\left(i\right),\ldots,\sigma^{r-1}\left(i\right)\right\} \subseteq[i].
\]

\end_inset

Now consider the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $i,\sigma\left(i\right),\sigma^{2}\left(i\right)\ldots$
\end_inset

.
 This sequence must eventually repeat because 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 is finite, so there exist 
\begin_inset Formula $k<l$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{k}\left(i\right)=\sigma^{l}\left(i\right).$
\end_inset

 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{i-k}\left(i\right)=i$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 be the smallest positive integer such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{r}\left(i\right)=i$
\end_inset

.
 Now it is clear that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[i]\subseteq\left\{ i,\sigma\left(i\right),\ldots,\sigma^{r-1}\left(i\right)\right\} .
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Hence

 implies that the cycles generate 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$

 It is a natural question to ask if there is a smaller subset which generates
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 In fact the 2-cycles generate 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "transpositions"

\end_inset

The transpositions generate 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
It suffices to prove that every permutation is a product of transpositions.
 We give two proofs of this fact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Here is the first proof.
 As every permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is a product of cycles, it suffices to check that every cycle is a product
 of transpositions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-cycle 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\left(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The idea of the proof is similar to the 
\emph on
bubble sort
\emph default
 algorithm.
 Think of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 as the ``heaviest object'' and we wish to send it to the bottom by exchanging
 it successively with 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{3}$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 The idea is succintly captured in the identity
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\left(a_{1},a_{k}\right)\left(a_{1},a_{k-1}\right)\left(a_{1},a_{k-2}\right)\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\left(a_{1},a_{2}\right).
\]

\end_inset

To prove this identity it suffices to check that they have the same effect
 on every integer 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now if 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is not equal to any of the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

, there is nothing to check as both sides fix 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $j=a_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(j)=a_{i+1}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand the transposition 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{1},a_{i})$
\end_inset

 sends 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

, the ones befores this do nothing to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, and the next transposition then sends 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i+1}$
\end_inset

.
 No other of the remaining transpositions have any effect on 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i+1}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the RHS also sends 
\begin_inset Formula $j=a_{i}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i+1}$
\end_inset

.
 As both sides have the same effect on 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, they are equal.
 This completes the first proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
To see how the second proof goes, think of a permutation as just being a
 rearrangement of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 numbers (like a deck of cards).
 If we can find a product of transpositions, that sends this rearrangement
 back to the trivial one, then we have shown that the inverse of the correspondi
ng permutation is a product of transpositions.
 Since a transposition is its own inverse, it follows that the original
 permutation is a product of transpositions (in fact the same product, but
 in the opposite order).
 In other words if
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau_{k}\cdot\tau_{k-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\tau_{3}\cdot\tau_{2}\cdot\tau_{1}\cdot\sigma=e,\label{eq:productoftranspositions}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

then multiplying on the right by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

, in the opposite order, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\tau_{1}\cdot\tau_{2}\cdot\tau_{3}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\tau_{k}.
\]

\end_inset

The idea is to put back the cards into the right position, one at a time.
 Suppose that the first 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 cards are in the right position.
 Suppose that the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th card is in position 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 As the first 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 cards are in the right position, 
\begin_inset Formula $j\geq i$
\end_inset

.
 We may assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $j>i$
\end_inset

, otherwise there is nothing to do.
 Now look at the transposition 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

.
 This puts the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th card into the right position.
 Thus we are done by induction on 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
We can also use the 
\emph on
bubble sort
\emph default
 in the reverse direction to show that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\left(a_{1},a_{k}\right)\left(a_{2},a_{k-1}\right)\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\left(a_{k-2},a_{k}\right)\left(a_{k-1},a_{k}\right).
\]

\begin_layout Corollary
Any permutation can be obtained from any other permutation by performing
 transpositions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma,\tau\in S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 From Eqn.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:productoftranspositions"

\end_inset

 in the proof of Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "transpositions"

\end_inset

 we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{k}\cdot\sigma_{k-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\sigma_{3}\cdot\sigma_{2}\cdot\sigma_{1}\cdot\sigma=e=\tau_{l}\cdot\tau_{l-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\tau_{3}\cdot\tau_{2}\cdot\tau_{1}\cdot\tau
\]

\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

's and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{j}$
\end_inset

's are transpositions.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau=\left(\tau_{1}\cdot\tau_{2}\cdot\tau_{3}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\tau_{l-1}\cdot\tau_{l}\right)\left(\sigma_{k}\cdot\sigma_{k-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\sigma_{3}\cdot\sigma_{2}\cdot\sigma_{1}\right)\cdot\sigma.

\begin_layout Subsection
Parity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that two permutations can be obtained from each other by performing
 transpositions.
 The number of transpositions needed to go from one permutation to another
 is not uniquely determined, i.e., we can go from one permutation to another
 by using different numbers of transpositions.
 However, the different numbers of transpositions needed to go from one
 permutation to the other are either all even or all odd; this can be expressed
 differently by saying that these numbers always have the same 
\emph on
parity
\emph default
.
 This is a very important result and to prove it we introduce the concept
 of inversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

By an 
\emph on
inversion
\emph default
, we mean the fact that two elements of a permutation do not appear in their

\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Permutations in which the number of inversions is an even number will be
 called 
\emph on
even
\emph default
 permutations and those in which the number of inversions is odd will be
 called 
\emph on

\emph default
 permutations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the number of inversions in the identity is zero; it is 1 in
 the trans[position 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2\right)$
\end_inset

 and 3 in the transposition 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,3\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "paritychange"

\end_inset

A transposition changes the number of inversions in a permutation by an
 odd number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Take any permutation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & \cdots & i & \cdots & j & \cdots & n\\
a_{1} & a_{2} & \cdots & a_{i} & \cdots & a_{j} & \cdots & a_{n}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Asuume that we carry out a transposition of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 After such a transposition, the position of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1,}a_{2},\ldots,a_{i-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j+1},a_{j+2},\ldots,a_{n}$
\end_inset

 remains unchanged.
 The only thing that changes is the position of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i+1},\ldots,a_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 and, of course, the position of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 with respect to each other.
 We now calculate the total change in the number of inversions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i+1},\ldots,a_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 number 
\begin_inset Formula $j-1-i$
\end_inset

 in all.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 of these elements are in natural order with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 form inversions with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 are in natural order with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 form inversions with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p+q=r+s=j-1-i.\label{eq:a}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As a result of the transposition, a natural ordering becomes an inversion,
 and conversely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
More precisely, if before the transposition the element 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 was in natural order with respect to an intermediate element, then after
 the transposition these two elements form an inversion, and conversely.
 The same is true for the element 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Thus, the total number of inversions of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the intermediate elements is 
\begin_inset Formula $q+s$
\end_inset

 before the transposition and 
\begin_inset Formula $p+r$
\end_inset

 after the transposition, i.e., the change in the number of inversions is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta=\left(p+r\right)-\left(q+s\right).
\]

\end_inset

Using Eqn.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:a"

\end_inset

, we can rewrite this number in the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta=\left(p+r\right)-\left(j-1-i-p+j-1-i-r\right)=2\left(p+r-j+i-1\right)
\]

\end_inset

from which it follows at once that the number 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is even.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
It remains to consider the relative position of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 themselves.
 If they were in natural order before the transposition, then they will
 form an inversion after the transposition, and conversely, i.e., the change
 in the number of inversions in this case is equal to 1.
 Thus, the total change in the number of inversions produced by a transposition
 is an odd number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now derive some consequences of this theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "noevenequalsnoodd"

\end_inset

The number of even permutations is equal to the number of odd permutations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For, if we write down all 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 permutations and transpose two given elements (e.g., the elements 1 and 3)
 in every one of them, then all even permutations become odd and conversely,
 and the net effect is to get back the whole set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 permutations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "evenoddpermutations"

\end_inset

Even permutations consists of permutations which are obtained from the identity
 permutation by an even number of transpositions, while the odd permutations
 consists of permutations which are obtained from the identity permutation
 by an odd number of transpositions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Follows from Eqn.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional presentation of normal subgroups and quotient groups goes
 something like this.
 First, you define a subgroup to be normal if it satisfies a certain funny
 condition.
 Then, given a group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and a normal subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, you show that you can define an operation on the cosets of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, and that that operation turns the set of all cosets into a group, called
 the quotient group.
 Ideally, you also show that one can’t give a natural group structure to
 the left cosets of an arbitrary subgroup: that justifies restricting attention
 to normal subgroups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There’s nothing terribly wrong with this approach, but it does leave one
 question unanswered: why bother with all this stuff? The traditional approach
 to that question is to ignore it, confident that the answer will gradually
 reveal itself.
 The more group theory you do, the more normal subgroups and quotients will
 arise naturally and demonstrate their utility, so if you just diligently
 keep studying, you will (fairly soon) come to regard normal subgroups and
 quotient groups as natural concepts that were obviously worth introducing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But a slight variant of the question is harder to answer: why did anybody
 bother to introduce these concepts in the first place? Surely the concepts
 were introduced for a reason, and not in the vague hope that they would
 turn out to be useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The obvious way of answering this second question is to look at the history.
 It turns out that normal subgroups were introduced by Galois (who was also
 the founder of group theory) as part of his study of the solubility of
 polynomials by radicals.
 That’s slightly unfortunate, since it means that to understand why normal
 subgroups were introduced, one has to put in a lot of work understanding
 about the theory of solving polynomials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there is another way of justifying the introduction of a new concept
 into mathematics.
 Instead of looking at the actual history of that concept, one can look
 at a 
\emph on
fictitious
\emph default
 history.
 If you can tell a plausible story about why a concept 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 have been invented, then that is sufficient to make it seem reasonable.
 It solves the mystery of how anyone could have thought of the concept,
 and it also shows that it was pretty well inevitable that the concept would
 have been introduced sooner or later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first phase of group theory (in this fictitious account) consisted in
 spotting that many mathematical structures, such as symmetries of Platonic
 solids, permutations of a finite set, non-singular 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrices, had features in common that could be abstracted out.
 This led to the formulation of the axioms for group theory: associativity,
 identity, inverses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was noticed very early---indeed, this observation was part of what drove
 the initial development of the subject---that two groups could be defined
 very differently and yet be ``basically the same''.
 For example, the group of rotations of a regular pentagon was basically
 the same as the group of integers mod 5 under addition, and the group of
 symmetries of a rectangle (that wasn’t a square) was basically the same
 as the group of transformations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{R}}^{3}$
\end_inset

 that consisted of the identity and the three half turns about the coordinate
 axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first attempts to make precise this intuition that groups could be ``differe
nt but basically the same'' were a little clumsy.
 Two groups 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 were said to be identical up to permutation and relabelling if you could
 find orderings of the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 such that if you formed the multiplication tables, then they would correspond,
 in the sense that if the element listed in the 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

th place times the element listed in the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

th place equals the element listed in the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

th place in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, then the same is true in 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 Later, this definition was tidied up so that it became the definition of
 isomorphism that we are now familiar with: an isomorphism from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is a bijection 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi:G\to H$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(xy)=\phi(x)\phi(y)$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y\in G$
\end_inset

.
 Two groups 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 were said to be isomorphic if there was an isomorphism between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Homomorphisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further important step was taken when it was observed that functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 that satisfy the multiplicativity property 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(xy)=\phi(x)\phi(y)$
\end_inset

 were interesting and important even if they weren’t bijections.
 To give just one of many examples, an extremely useful property of determinants
 is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(AB)$
\end_inset

 is always equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(A)\det(B)$
\end_inset

.
 Phenomena such as this led people to study what were initially called 
\emph on
multiplicative
\emph default
 functions between groups.
 Later, they were renamed 
\emph on
homomorphisms
\emph default
, to stress the similarity with isomorphisms.
\end_layout

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\colon G\longrightarrow H$
\end_inset

 be a homomorphism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(i) 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(e\right)=f$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 maps the identity in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to the identity in 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(ii) 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)=\phi\left(a\right)^{-1}$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 maps inverses to inverses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(iii) If 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is a subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(K\right)$
\end_inset

 is a subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\phi\left(e\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is the identity in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a & = & \phi\left(e\right)\\
 & = & \phi\left(ee\right)\\
 & = & \phi\left(e\right)\phi\left(e\right)\\
 & = & a^{2}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Cancelling we get 
\begin_inset Formula $a=f$
\end_inset

, the identity in 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 Hence (i).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $b=a^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
f & = & \phi\left(e\right)\\
 & = & \phi\left(ab\right)\\
 & = & \phi\left(a\right)\phi\left(b\right),
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
f & = & \phi\left(e\right)\\
 & = & \phi\left(ba\right)\\
 & = & \phi\left(b\right)\phi\left(a\right).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

But then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(b\right)$
\end_inset

 is the inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)=\phi\left(a\right)^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence (ii).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\phi\left(K\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It suffices to check that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is non-empty and closed under products and inverses.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 contains 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 the identity of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, by (i).
 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is closed under inverses by (ii) and closed under products, by definition
 of homomorphism.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is a subgroup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi:G\to H$
\end_inset

 is a multiplicative function, or homomorphism, then the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=e$
\end_inset

 forms a subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, many natural subgroups occur in that way.
 For example, the group of rotations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{R}}^{3}$
\end_inset

 is what you get if you take the group of all rigid motions of

 For that and many similar reasons, the notion of the

(i) We have to show that the kernel is non-empty and closed under products

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(e\right)=f$

 by Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

(i).
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\textrm{ker }\phi}$
\end_inset

 is certainly non-empty.
 Now suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$

 are in the kernel, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(a)=\phi(b)=f$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi\left(ab\right) & = & \phi\left(a\right)\phi\left(b\right)\\
 & = & f^{2}\\
 & = & f.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $ab\in\textrm{ker \phi\ }$
\end_inset

and so the kernel is closed under products.
 Finally suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(a\right)=f$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)=\phi\left(a\right)^{-1}=f$
\end_inset

, where we used Lemma

 Thus the kernel is closed under inverses, and the kernel is a subgroup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
(ii) 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\textrm{Im\ensuremath{\left(\phi\right)}}$

 with

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(ab\right)=hk$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(a^{-1}\right)=h^{-1}$
\end_inset

 showing that

 is a subgroup.

Here are some basic results about the kernel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "injectivehomo"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\colon G\longrightarrow H$
\end_inset

 be a group homomorphism.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is injective iff
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\textrm{ker }\phi}=\left\{ e\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
If 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is injective, then at most one element can be sent to the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in H$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(e\right)=f$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\textrm{ker }\phi}=\left\{ e\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\textrm{ker }\phi}=\left\{ e\right\} $
\end_inset

 and suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(x\right)=\phi\left(y\right).$
\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $g=x^{-1}y.$
\end_inset

 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi\left(g\right) & = & \phi\left(x^{-1}y\right)\\
 & = & \phi\left(x\right)^{-1}\phi\left(y\right)\\
 & = & f.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Thus g is in the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $g=e$
\end_inset

.
 But then 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{-1}y=e$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $x=y$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is injective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By this time, people had got a bit of a taste for the purely abstract study
 of group theory: it excited them that they could think about a group such
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{5}$
\end_inset

 without saying whether its elements were rotations of a pentagon or integers
 mod 5 or something else entirely.
 So people started studying groups 
\emph on
for their own sake
\emph default
.
 And one of the first questions they asked was this: we know that kernels
 of homomorphisms are subgroups, but what about the converse? That is, is
 every subgroup the kernel of some homomorphism?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem turned out not to be very interesting, since there were easy
 counterexamples.
 For example, if you take the permutation group 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{3}$
\end_inset

 and take the subgroup that consists of the identity and the transposition
 
\begin_inset Formula $(12)$
\end_inset

, then that is not the kernel of any homomorphism.
 The original proof of this fact went something like this.
 Suppose we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $(12)$
\end_inset

 goes to the identity.
 We can use that to deduce that, say, 
\begin_inset Formula $(23)$
\end_inset

 also goes to the identity.
 We do this by ``using 
\begin_inset Formula $(12)$
\end_inset

 to do 
\begin_inset Formula $(23)$
\end_inset

'' as follows.
 We first find a permutation that switches 1 and 3---the obvious one being
 
\begin_inset Formula $(13)$
\end_inset

.
 We then switch 1 and 3, perform the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $(12)$
\end_inset

 and finally switch 1 and 3 back again.
 More formally, we calculate the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $(13)(12)(13)$
\end_inset

, and we note that because we began and ended by swapping 1 and 3 round,
 this new permutation does to 3 what the old one did to 1 and vice versa.
 So the resulting permutation is 
\begin_inset Formula $(32)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $(12)$
\end_inset

---and 
\begin_inset Formula $(32)$
\end_inset

 is the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $(23)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does that prove? Well, if we now think about what 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(23)$
\end_inset

 must be, it is the result of multiplying 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(13)$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(12)$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(13)$
\end_inset

.
 But since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(12)$
\end_inset

 is the identity and 
\begin_inset Formula $(13)$
\end_inset

 is its own inverse, we end up just doing 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(13)$
\end_inset

 and inverting it again.
 This shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $(23)$
\end_inset

 also belongs to the kernel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was soon realized that this basic trick could be used to generate lots
 of counterexamples.
 All you had to do was find a group

\end_inset

, an element 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}$

 was not in

\begin_layout Lemma

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 be a subgroup of a group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 Then the following statements are equivalent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(i) 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(ii) For every 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $gHg^{-1}=H.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(iii) 
\begin_inset Formula $Hg=gH$
\end_inset

, for every 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Clearly (ii) and (iii) are equivalent and (ii) implies (i) since 
\begin_inset Formula $gHg^{-1}\subseteq H.$
\end_inset

 Thus it remains to show that (i) implies (ii).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Suppose that (i) holds.
 Then for each 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
gHg^{-1}\subseteq H.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now replace 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g^{-1}Hg\subseteq H,
\]

\end_inset

so that multiplying on the left by 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and the right by 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\subseteq gHg^{-1}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Thus (ii) holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what about the converse? Is every subgroup that is closed under conjugation
 the kernel of some homomorphism?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This question is an example of a phenomenon that occurs frequently in mathematic
s.
 You find a very simple 
\emph on
necessary
\emph default
 condition for something to be the case.
 (In this example, being closed under conjugation is a necessary condition
 for a subgroup to be the kernel of a homomorphism.) You then attempt to
 show that that condition is 
\emph on
sufficient
\emph default
.
 It’s always a pleasant surprise when you manage, since it is far from obvious
 in advance that the conditions you have identified are the only obstacles
 to getting what you want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, for instance, it isn’t obvious at all that just because a subgroup
 satisfies a condition that it clearly has to satisfy, it must be the kernel
 of some homomorphism.
 Where’s that homomorphism going to come from? There isn’t another group
 around, let alone a map from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to that group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem was found quite hard at the time, though the technique used
 to solve it has since become standard.
 The original thought process that led to a solution went something like
 this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
If you are trying to find something complicated but have no idea where to
 start, then pretend you’ve found what you are looking for and see what
 you can say about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So let’s pretend we have a homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to some group 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 and that the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 What can we say about 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, one thing we know immediately is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(h)=e$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

, since that was our initial assumption.
 What can we do with that information? One thing it tells us is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=\phi(gh)$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

, and also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=\phi(hg)$
\end_inset

.
 So that tells us that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=\phi(g')$
\end_inset

 whenever we can find 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g'=hg$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $g'=gh$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let’s explore that a little more.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 be an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 Can we say precisely for which elements 
\begin_inset Formula $g'\in G$
\end_inset

 it must be the case that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=\phi(g')$
\end_inset

? We’ve shown that it must when 
\begin_inset Formula $g'=hg$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $gh$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

.
 To prove that, we used the fact that every 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

 belongs to the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 But we also know the converse: that every element of the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 belongs to 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 So if 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=\phi(g')$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}g'\in H$
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g^{-1}g')=\phi(g^{-1})\phi(g')=\phi(g)^{-1}\phi(g)=e$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we have just established, using only the information that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=\phi(g')$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}g'\in H$
\end_inset

, which is the same as saying that 
\begin_inset Formula $g'\in gH$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where have we got to now? We have shown that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is a homomorphism from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to a group 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, and if the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 must be constant on the sets 
\begin_inset Formula $gH.$
\end_inset

 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 must take a different value on 
\begin_inset Formula $g'H$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $gH\neq g'H.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I could have argued slightly differently.
 I could have shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=\phi(g')$
\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g'g^{-1})=e$
\end_inset

, and therefore concluded that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g)=\phi(g')$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $g'g^{-1}\in H$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $g'\in Hg$
\end_inset

.
 This would have shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is constant on 
\begin_inset Formula $Hg$
\end_inset

, and that it takes a different value on 
\begin_inset Formula $Hg'$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $Hg\neq Hg'$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two observations are incompatible with each other unless 
\begin_inset Formula $gH=Hg'$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $g'\in G.$
\end_inset

 and vice versa.
 So we’d better check that.
 What is a good choice for 
\begin_inset Formula $g'$
\end_inset

? Well, 
\begin_inset Formula $Hg'$
\end_inset

 had better contain 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $Hg$
\end_inset

 is a pretty obvious choice.
 Does 
\begin_inset Formula $gH=Hg$
\end_inset

? The answer is yes if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $gHg^{-1}=H$
\end_inset

.
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is closed under conjugation, so by Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "normalequivdef"

\end_inset

(ii) we’re OK.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We state the above results as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "homoconstcosets"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 be a homomorphism from a group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to some group 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 and that the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is constant on 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in H$
\end_inset

 but takes a different value on 
\begin_inset Formula $g'H$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $gH\neq g'H$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover 
\begin_inset Formula $gH=Hg$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note*
The above discussion also shows that the collection of sets 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

 form a disjoint partition of 
\begin_inset Formula $G.$
\end_inset

 This should suggest some equivalence relation lurking around.
 We shall return to this later.
 For the time being let us use the standard terminology 
\emph on
left coset
\emph default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

 and 
\emph on
right coset
\emph default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $Hg.$
\end_inset

 In the present case since left and right cosets coincide we just call them
 cosets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is that all we can say? Very much not.
 If we have an ounce of mathematical curiosity, then sooner or later we
 will start to wonder whether we can say anything about how the values of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 on different cosets are related to each other.
 If we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 takes the value 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 everywhere on the coset 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}H$
\end_inset

 and the value 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 everywhere on the coset 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}H$
\end_inset

, can we deduce anything from that? Well, the main thing we know about 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is that it is a homomorphism, so let’s try to use that fact.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{1},h_{2}\in H$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{1}h_{1})=a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{2}h_{2})=b$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{1}h_{1}g_{2}h_{2})=ab$
\end_inset

, by the multiplicativity property.
 By what we have just established, that tells us that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 will take the value 
\begin_inset Formula $ab$
\end_inset

 on the entire coset to which 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}h_{1}g_{2}h_{2}$
\end_inset

 belongs.
 But what is that coset? To answer that we would like to rewrite 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}h_{1}g_{2}h_{2}$
\end_inset

 as a product that begins with something in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and ends with something in 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 It would be nice if we could let 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}$
\end_inset

 swap places.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can we say that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{1}g_{2}=g_{2}h_{1}$
\end_inset

? Unfortunately not.
 But let’s play around a little.
 We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is closed under conjugation, so we might try to find a conjugation.
 And we can! Rearranging the equation we were hoping for gives us that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}^{-1}h_{1}g_{2}=h_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 There is no reason to suppose that that is true, but we do at least know
 that the left hand side belongs to 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 So we can at least write 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}^{-1}h_{1}g_{2}=h_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 And rearranging that tells us that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}h_{3}=h_{1}g_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}h_{1}g_{2}h_{2}=g_{1}g_{2}h_{3}h_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 That tells us that the coset that contains 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}h_{1}g_{2}h_{2}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}g_{2}H$
\end_inset

, which is as nice an answer as we could have hoped for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does this tell us? Let’s write 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(gH)=a$
\end_inset

 to mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 takes the value 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 everywhere on the coset 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

.
 Then we have shown that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{1}H)=a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{2}H)=b$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{1}g_{2}H)=ab$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, we’ve found all sorts of properties that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 must have, but are we any nearer to finding 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

? Yes we are, in that losing-at-chess sense that our options are getting
 more and more restricted, which makes it easier to work out what to do.
 Here’s a trick that reduces our options still further.
 One of the observations we have made is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is constant on every coset and takes different values on different cosets.
 That means that there is a bijection between the cosets of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and the elements of the image of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does that help when we don’t actually know what 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is, or what its image is? It actually helps a lot.
 We are free to 
\emph on
define
\emph default
 the image.
 Can we think of a set that’s in one-to-one correspondence with the set
 of all cosets of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

? Yes of course we can: just take the set itself!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But hang on, you might say, isn’t that a bit dangerous? There are lots of
 sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with any given set, so what
 reason is there to think that the set itself is a good choice? Well, here
 are two reasons.

\end_inset

We are given absolutely no data in the problem other than the group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and the subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, so it is highly likely that the homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and the group 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 maps to will be built out of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 in some way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In a sense it doesn’t actually matter what set we define the group operation
 on, since if we define it on a set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta:X\to Y$
\end_inset

 is a bijection, then we can use the group operation on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 to define essentially the same group operation on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}\circ y_{2}=\beta(\beta^{-1}(y_{1})\circ\beta^{-1}(y_{2}))$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now we’ve managed to cut things down further.
 We want to define a binary operation on the set of all cosets of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 that will make it into a group, and we want the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 that takes 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 to the coset 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

 to be a homomorphism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let’s go back to what we have managed to establish about 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 An important property was that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{1}g_{2}H)=\phi(g_{1}H)\phi(g_{2}H)$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(gH)$
\end_inset

 meant the constant value that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 takes on the coset 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

).
 But now we’ve decided that we’re going to define 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(gH)$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

 itself.
 The only thing that we haven’t decided is what the binary operation on
 the set of all cosets should be.
 But what we established earlier about 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 forces our hand completely.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{1}H)\phi(g_{2}H)$
\end_inset

 must equal 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(g_{1}g_{2}H)$
\end_inset

 and since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(gH)=gH$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $(g_{1}H)\circ(g_{2}H)$
\end_inset

 must be 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}g_{2}H$
\end_inset

.
 We have arrived at the definition of the quotient group
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Usually when the quotient group is defined, one defines the binary operation
 on the set of cosets and then checks that it is well-defined.
 In the course of the above thoughts, we have basically already checked
 this.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the quotient map, and thereby solved the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my fictitious world, there was one final stage in the early development
 of group theory, which was that all the thoughts that led to the definition
 of the quotient group were carefully suppressed.
 The solution to the kernels classification problem was presented like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "quotgroup"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $H\vartriangleleft G$
\end_inset

.
 Then the set of cosets 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

 forms a group under the composition
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(g_{1}H\right)\circ\left(g_{2}H\right)=\left\{ xy\,\colon\, x\in g_{1}H,\, y\in g_{2}H\right\} =g_{1}g_{2}H.
\]

\end_inset

This group is called the 
\emph on
quotient group
\emph default
 and denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $G/H$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
Furthermore there is a 
\series bold
natural
\series default
 surjective homomorphism
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pi\colon\, G\longrightarrow G/H,
\]

\end_inset

defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\left(g\right)=gH.$
\end_inset

 Moreover the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The discussion immediately preceding the Theorem (which depends only on
 normality of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

) shows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ xy\,\colon\, x\in g_{1}H,\, y\in g_{2}H\right\} =g_{1}g_{2}H.
\]

\end_inset

We check the three axioms for a group.
 We first check associativity.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 are in G.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(aH\right)\circ\left(bH\circ cH\right) & = & \left(aH\right)\circ\left(bcH\right)\\
 & = & \left(a\left(bc\right)\right)H\\
 & = & \left(\left(ab\right)c\right)H\\
 & = & \left(ab\right)H\circ cH\\
 & = & \left(aH\circ bH\right)\circ H.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Thus this rule of multiplication is associative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
It is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $eH=H$
\end_inset

 plays the role of the identity.
 Indeed 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(aH\right)\circ\left(eH\right)=aeH=aH=\left(eH\right)\circ\left(aH\right).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Finally given a left coset 
\begin_inset Formula $aH$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{-1}H$
\end_inset

 is easily seen to be the inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $aH$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $G/H$
\end_inset

 certainly does form a group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
It is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is a surjective homomorphism: 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(g_{1}g_{2})=g_{1}g_{2}H$
\end_inset

, which, by definition of the group operation on 
\begin_inset Formula $G/H$
\end_inset

, is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}H\circ g_{2}H$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is a homomorphism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Obviously, if 
\begin_inset Formula $gH\in G/H$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\left(g\right)=gH$
\end_inset

.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is surjective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Finally if 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\left(h\right)=hH=H$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $H\subset\textrm{ker \ensuremath{\pi}. }$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Conversely suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in\mathrm{ker}\pi$
\end_inset

 i.e.,
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(g)=gH=H$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in H$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{ker}\pi\subset H$
\end_inset

 so the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, as required.

Let

 The set of left (or right) cosets effect a partition of

\begin_layout Proof
Clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in gH$

We will next show that any two left cosets are either disjoint or equal.
 Let us suppose that

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $x=ah_{1}=bh_{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $a=bh_{2}h_{1}^{-1}.$

\begin_layout Proof
We will show that

 Let

\begin_inset Formula $g=bh_{2}h_{1}^{-1}h\in H.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Similarly

\end_inset

 Thus the cosets 
\begin_inset Formula $aH$

 are equal.
 This proves that the set of left cosets effect a partition of

\begin_layout Proof
Suppose now that

\begin_inset Formula $a=gh_{1},b=gh_{2}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{-1}a=h_{2}^{-1}h_{1}\in H.$
\end_inset

 Conversely 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{-1}a\in H$

Let

This map is well defined as well as injective because

\begin_layout Standard
Let

be an equivalence relation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{n}$

 are

 distinct equivalence classes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$

so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X=\bigcup_{i=i}^{n}A_{i}

\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|X\right|={\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|A_{i}\right|}.
\]

\end_inset

In particular if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|A_{i}\right|=m$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|X\right|=m\cdot n$

 Thus an equivalence relation can be used to count the elements of a set
 or if the count is known then it allows us to determine the number of equivalen

 In the latter case

 Define a map
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $B(k)=g^{-1}k$

 These maps are both clearly well-defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We show that 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 We first compute
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B\circ A\colon\, H\longrightarrow H.
\]

\end_inset

Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(B\circ A\right)\left(h\right) & = & B\left(A\left(h\right)\right)\\
 & = & B\left(gh\right)\\
 & = & g^{-1}\left(gh\right)\\
 & = & h.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Now consider
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\circ B\colon\, gH\longrightarrow gH.
\]

\end_inset

Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in gH$

\begin_inset Formula

 & = & k.

\begin_inset Formula $A$

In Lemma

 we saw that an abelian group is normal.
 It is easy to find examples to show that the converse is not true.
 For example take 
\begin_inset Formula $G=D_{3}$
\end_inset

 the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.
 This group consists of the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $I,R$
\end_inset

 a rotation through 
\begin_inset Formula $60^{\circ}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 together with three flips which are reflections in the medians.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\left\{ I,R,R^{2}\right\} .$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G.$
\end_inset

 To verify this first suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in H.$
\end_inset

 Then clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}\in H$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H.$
\end_inset

 Otherwise 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is a flip.
 Let us suppose that it is 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1}$
\end_inset

 Now pick 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

 and consider 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $h=I$
\end_inset

 then it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}=I\in H$
\end_inset

.
 So suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $h=R$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
ghg^{-1} & = & F_{1}RF_{1}\\
 & = & R^{2}\in H.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Similarly, if 
\begin_inset Formula $h=R^{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}=R\in H$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 Now suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $h=F_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g=R$

 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
ghg^{-1} & = & RF_{1}R\\
 & = & F_{2}\not\neq F_{1}

\end_inset

so 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 By definition this means that there is an element

 But then 
\begin_inset Formula $a=g^{-1}bg=hbh^{-1}$

 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $b\sim a$

Finally suppose that

We have been studying the properties of conjugation

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 was more or less fixed and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 was varying.
 Now we look at the conjugation map when 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is fixed but 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 varies over the group.
 Then the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g}\colon\, x\longmapsto gxg^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is an isomorphism of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 onto iteslf.
 We can think of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g}$
\end_inset

 as a permutation on 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 These permutations form a subgroup of the group of all permutations on
 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 with the group operation composition of maps.
 It turns out that the mapping

Let

 be a group and let 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

 be an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 The map
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\end_inset

defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Phi_{g}\left(x\right)=gxg^{-1}

\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 Further
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Phi_{g}\circ\Phi_{h}=\Phi_{gh}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We first check that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g}$
\end_inset

 is a bijection with inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g^{-1}}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(\Phi_{g^{-1}}\circ\Phi_{g}\right)\left(x\right) & = & \Phi_{g^{-1}}\left(\Phi_{g}\left(x\right)\right)\\
 & = & \Phi_{g^{-1}}\left(gxg^{-1}\right)\\
 & = & g^{-1}\left(gxg^{-1}\right)g\\
 & = & x.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Thus the composite 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g^{-1}}\circ\Phi_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the identity.
 Similarly the composite 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g}\circ\Phi_{g^{-1}}$
\end_inset

 is the identity.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g}$
\end_inset

 is a bijection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now we check that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi_{g}\left(xy\right) & = & gxyg^{-1}\\
 & = & \left(gxg^{-1}\right)\left(gyg^{-1}\right)\\
 & = & \Phi_{g}\left(x\right)\Phi_{g}\left(y\right).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The computation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{g}\circ\Phi_{h}$

 is similar to that of

so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(gh\right)x=g\left(xh\right)=\left(xg\right)h=x\left(gh\right).

\end_inset

This shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $gh\in C_{G}\left(x\right)$

 In particular every element of

 The equivalence class of

\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}$
\end_inset

 be two elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 that belong to the same coset (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}H=g_{2}H$
\end_inset

).
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}^{-1}g_{2}$
\end_inset

 is an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $f(g_{1}^{-1}g_{2})=e$
\end_inset

 (because 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

).
 Now, the rules of homomorphism show that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(g_{1})^{-1}f(g_{2})=e$
\end_inset

 and that is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $f(g_{1})=f(g_{2})$
\end_inset

 which implies the equality 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(g_{1}H)=\theta(g_{2}H)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Next we verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is a homomorphism.
 Take two cosets 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}H$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}H$
\end_inset

, then: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{llll}
\theta(g_{1}H\cdot g_{2}H) & = & \theta(g_{1}g_{2}H) & \text{(operation in \ensuremath{G/K})}\\
 & = & f(g_{1}g_{2}) & \text{(definition of \ensuremath{\theta})}\\
 & = & f(g_{1})f(g_{2}) & \text{(\ensuremath{f}is an homomorphism)}\\
 & = & \theta(g_{1}H)\theta(g_{2}H)\  & \text{(definition of \ensuremath{\theta})}
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

Finally, we show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is an isomorphism (i.e.
 a bijection).
 The kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 consists of all cosets 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $G/H$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(g)=e$
\end_inset

 but these are exactly the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 that belong to 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 so only the coset 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is in the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 which implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is an injection.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $k=f(g)$
\end_inset

 be an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(G)$
\end_inset

.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(gH)$
\end_inset

 equals 
\begin_inset Formula $f(g)$
\end_inset

 thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(gH)=h$
\end_inset

 and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is surjective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The theorem is proved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
Some version of the theorem also state that the following diagram is commutative
:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\xymatrix{G\ar[rd]_{f}\ar[r]^{\pi} & G/H\ar[d]_{\theta}\\
 & K
}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is the natural projection that takes 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $gH$
\end_inset

.
 We will conclude by verifying this.
 Take 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(\pi(g))=\theta(gH)=f(g)$
\end_inset

 as needed.

Let

 be a group,

\end_inset

 a normal subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 be the canonical homomorphism from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $G/N$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(H)=\left(HN\right)/N$
\end_inset

 and is isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $H/\left(H\cap N\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The image of 
\begin_inset Formula $HN$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 are same under 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(hn)=\pi(h)\pi(n)=\pi(h)$
\end_inset

.
 Also 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is a normal subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $HN$
\end_inset

 and the restriction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $HN$
\end_inset

 is also a homomorphism with kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 By the first isomorphism theorem 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(H)=\pi(HN)=\left(HN\right)/N$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The restriction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is a homomorphism with kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $H\cap N$
\end_inset

.
 Again by the first isomorphism theorem 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(H)$
\end_inset

 is isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $H/\left(H\cap N\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This completes the proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
The basic idea of the proof is to ``count'' the number of distinct cosets
 
\begin_inset Formula $hN$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to verify that any such coset is a member of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(HN\right)/N$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $H/\left(H\cap N\right)$
\end_inset

 and vice-versa.
 For example if 
\begin_inset Formula $gN=hN$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $g=g\circ e$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\subset HN$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
We can give an alternate proof by defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\colon H\to\left(HN\right)/N$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(h\right)=hN$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to verify that

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 be a normal subgroup of a group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 be a subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 that contains 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 .
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $H/N$
\end_inset

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G/N$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $gN(H/N)(gN)^{-1}\in G/N.$
\end_inset

 An element of this set is: 
\begin_inset Formula $(gN)(hN)(g^{-1}N)=ghg^{-1}N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, for each 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

 there exists 
\begin_inset Formula $h'\in H$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}=h'$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $(gN)(hN)(g^{-1}N)=h'N$
\end_inset

, which is in 
\begin_inset Formula $H/N$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $gN(H/N)(gN)^{-1}\subseteq H/N$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $H/N$
\end_inset

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G/N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $H/N$

 is normal in 
\begin_inset Formula $G/N$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $(gN)(H/N)(gN)^{-1}\subseteq H/N$
\end_inset

 Then for each 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in H$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $(gN)(hN)(g^{-1}N)=h'N$
\end_inset

, for some 
\begin_inset Formula $h'\in H$
\end_inset

, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}N=h'N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Thus for every 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in N$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}n=h'n'$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $n'\in N$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $ghg^{-1}=h'n'n^{-1}$
\end_inset

, which is in 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 As 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 was any element of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $gHg^{-1}\subseteq H$

\begin_layout Chapter
Cayley Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with ``counting Cayley tables'' is that they mostly only come
 up at the beginning of one's study of group theory, whereas it takes some
 group-theoretic sophistication to understand how and what to count, especially
 when two Cayley tables are to be regarded as distinct.
 In order to avoid a lot of tables which are permutations of each other,
 let's adopt the convention that whenever a product of two group elements
 is an element that hasn't yet appeared above and to the left of it in the
 table, one should name the new element with the next available letter in
 the alphabet or the identity .
 We illustrate this with the classification of all groups of order 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is one possibility:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline +_{\mathbb{\boldsymbol{\mathbf{Z}}}_{2}\times\mathbb{\boldsymbol{\mathbf{Z}}}_{2}} & e & a & b & c\\
\hline e & e & a & b & c\\
\hline a & a & e & c & b\\
\hline b & b & c & e & a\\
\hline c & c & b & a & e
\\\hline \end{array}
\]

\end_inset

Let us go through the steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first row is clear since 
\begin_inset Formula $e\circ x=x$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the second row we set 
\begin_inset Formula $a\circ a=e$
\end_inset

 sinc 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 has not appeared to the left or above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then 
\begin_inset Formula $a\circ b$
\end_inset

 has to be 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a\circ c=b$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the third row 
\begin_inset Formula $b\circ b=e$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally the last row is uniquely determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an example of the so called 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now suppose we set 
\begin_inset Formula $a\circ a=b$
\end_inset

 (the next available letter) in step 2 above.
 Then we shall get the following table:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline +_{4} & e & a & b & c\\
\hline e & e & a & b & c\\
\hline a & a & b & c & e\\
\hline b & b & c & e & a\\
\hline c & c & e & a & b
\\\hline \end{array}
\]

\end_inset

This is the abelian group of the integers modulo 4: 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbb{\boldsymbol{\mathbf{Z}}}/(4),+_{4})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following Cayley table for the group formed by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,i,-i,-1\right\} $
\end_inset

of the fourth roots of unity:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \cdot_{\mathbb{C}} & e & a & b & c\\
\hline e & e & a & b & c\\
\hline a & a & c & e & b\\
\hline b & b & e & c & a\\
\hline c & c & b & a & e
\\\hline \end{array}
\]

\end_inset

Suppose we exchange rows 3 and 4.
 We shall get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \cdot_{\mathbb{C}} & e & a & b & c\\
\hline e & e & a & b & c\\
\hline a & a & c & e & b\\
\hline c & c & b & a & e\\
\hline b & b & e & c & a
\\\hline \end{array}
\]

\end_inset

 Likewise we permute the columns 3 and 4.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \cdot_{\mathbb{C}} & e & a & c & b\\
\hline e & e & a & c & b\\
\hline a & a & c & b & e\\
\hline c & c & b & e & a\\
\hline b & b & e & a & c
\\\hline \end{array}
\]

\end_inset

 This is the same as the Cayley table for the abelian group of the integers
 modulo 4 if we rename 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and vice-versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next consider the following Cayley table for the group formed by

\end_inset

of the fourth roots of unity:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \cdot_{\mathbb{C}} & e & a & b & c\\
\hline e & e & a & b & c\\
\hline a & a & e & c & b\\
\hline b & b & c & a & e\\
\hline c & c & b & e & a
\\\hline \end{array}
\]

\end_inset

 Again exchange rows 2 and 3 and columns 2 and 3 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \cdot_{\mathbb{C}} & e & b & a & c\\

\hline b & b & a & c & e\\
\hline a & a & c & e & b\\
\hline c & c & e & b & a
